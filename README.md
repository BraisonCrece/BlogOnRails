# BlogOnRails :pencil2: :page_facing_up:

As I go deeper into Ruby on Rails I discover many sections that were not easy for me to learn at the beginning. Therefore, I would like to share those "discoveries" with the intention of helping anyone else who is in the process of learning Rails.

This application is going to be a blog about Ruby on Rails and its ecosystem.

Having to write articles, **I will have to do a lot of research on the topic beforehand**. 

 :construction_worker: It will be managed 100% by me, and the informative articles will be written to be **easily understood** (as much as possible).

My main goal is to make the platform a **win/win** (users access to interesting information / I learn and practice).



### It will consist of the following sections:

- Informative articles about using Ruby on Rails.
- MarkDown + code highlighting
- Articles organized by tags
- User login system
- Internal messaging
- discussion forum
- comments in the articles
- favorites button
- article search bar
